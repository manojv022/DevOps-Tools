**What Is Docker File**

1. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains instructions for building Docker images. These instructions guide Docker in assembling an image by executing commands in a specific order.

2. The Dockerfile uses DSL (Domain Specific Language) and contains instructions for generating a Docker image. Dockerfile will define the processes to quickly produce an image. While creating your application, you should create a Dockerfile in order since the Docker daemon runs all of the instructions from top to bottom.
